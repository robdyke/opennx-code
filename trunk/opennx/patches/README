This directory contains various patches for NoMachine's packages:

<pkgname>-autotools.patch:

 These patches fix the incredibly clumbsy buildr environments of the various
 packages. All packages (except nxssh) now use a decent autotools setup which
 solves LOT of build problems (e.g.: building universal binaries on MacOS etc.).

nxcomp-gcc44.patch:

 This patch fixes a compile error with gcc 4.4 on F11

openssh-scard-pin.patch:

 This patch fixes a bug in nxssh. (nxssh did not ask for a SmartCard-PIN)

nxssh-newbuild.patch (currently used on MacOS only):

 This patch adapts nxssh to the new build environment used in opennx.
