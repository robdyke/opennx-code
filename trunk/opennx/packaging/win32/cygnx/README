In order to build an OpenNX installer package which
uses the original nxssh.exe and nxesd.exe,
you can do the following:

1. Install the Innosetup Quickstart Package from
   http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php (On Linux, do this inside wine).
2. Fetch NoMachine's nxclient windows installer into this directory
3. Fetch innounp from http://sourceforge.net/projects/innounp/files/
   and put the innounp.exe into this directory.
4. Run innounp.exe -x nxclient-x.y.z.exe (On Linux, use wine, e.g.:
   wine innounp.exe -x nxclient-x.y.z.exe)

After that, you should see a directory named '{app}' which contains
the package contents.

5. Go to the toplevel and configure OpenNX using the option
    --with-orignx

   Here is the config cmd which I use on my Fedora:

   mingw32-configure \
    --enable-staticwx \
    --with-orignx \
    --with-dllpath=/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin \
    --with-wx-config=/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin/wx-config \
    --with-wine-iscc="$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Inno\ Setup\ 5/ISCC.exe"

   mingw32-configure is a wrapper from Fedora's mingw32 environment. Please also
   note the double-quoting of the iscc path.

6. Run make dist-platform

When running ISCC in wine during the last build step, sometimes ISCC aborts with a
false "out of memory" error. If that happens, simply run make dist-platform again,
it should go very quickly, because everything is already built ...
