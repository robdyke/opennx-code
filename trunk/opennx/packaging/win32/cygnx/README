In order to build an OpenNX package which
uses the original nxssh.exe and nxesd.exe,
you can do the following:

1. Fetch NoMachine's nxclient windows installer into this directory
2. Fetch innounp from http://sourceforge.net/projects/innounp/files/
   and put the innounp.exe into this directory.
3. Run innounp.exe -x nxclient-x.y.z.exe (On Linux, use wine, e.g.:
   wine innounp.exe -x nxclient-x.y.z.exe)

After that, you should see a directory named '{app}' which contains
the package contents.

4. Go to the toplevel and configure OpenNX using the option
   --with-orignx.
5. Run make dist-target
