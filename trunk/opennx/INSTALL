This file contains instructions specivic to OpenNX only. Generic
installation instructions are described in INSTALL.generic.

1. Supported target systems:

This package has been tested on Linux, OpenBSD, Mac OSX and Windows (with MinGW)

1. Prerequisites:

    For building on Windows, you need the latest MinGW/MSYS development system
    (See http://www.mingw.org). Since currently (Sep. 2008) only old installers
    are officially available at SourceForge, you probably are better suited
    when using my custom installer. Fetch it from
    http://www.fritz-elfert.de/downloads/mingw+msys-092008-setup.exe
    It contains a complete MinGW/MSYS environment plus a pre-built wxWidgets-2.8.8
    framework, containing the patches mentioned below.

    On all other systems, you will just need a patched wxWidgets of version
    2.8.6 or later. There is one mandatory patch (which is in wxWidgets' SVN-HEAD,
    but unfortunately NOT in it's branches). You can fetch it at
    http://downloads.sourceforge.net/opennx/wx-2.8-cmdline.patch
    The other wxWidgets patch is optional and adds the ability to generate trace
    logs in release-builds. (Normally, this feature is only availabe in debug
    builds). This patch is available at
    http://downloads.sourceforge.net/opennx/wx-2.8-debuglog.patch

    When using an SVN-checkout, in addition, you need GNU autotools, GNU gettext
    and GNU libtool in order to generate the necessary support files.

2. Configuring the package:

    When using an SVN-checkout, the missing support files can be generated by
    invoking make -f Makefile.am
    This step is NOT necessary when building from a source tarball.

    Normally, you simply will run the command sequence:

        ./configure
        make
        make install

    Options to ./configure, specific to OpenNX are:

        Application features:
        --enable-unicode (Enables a unicode build [Default: YES])
        --enable-warn (Enables some additional g++ warnings [Default: NO])
        --enable-smartcard (Enables SmartCard support [Default: NO])
        --with-nxproto=x.x.x (Can be used to tweak the NX protocol version [Default: 2.1.0])

        Build environment tweaks:
        --with-samba=DIR (Can be used to specify the samba source for finding smbclient.h)
        --with-wxdir=PATH (Can be used to specify an uninstalled version of wxWidgets)
        --with-wx-config=CONFIG (Can be used to specify a custom wx-config script to use)
    
    All other (generic) options are documented in the file INSTALL.generic

3. Running OpenNX:

    OpenNX is a drop-in replacement for nxclient. Therefore, in order to be of any
    practical use, you need the usual NX environment for your platform. Furthermore,
    the application binary MUST be named nxclient (because that name is hardcoded in
    Nomachine's nxssh)! In order to use the SmartCard feature, you also need to rebuild
    nxssh from source, enabling it's already existing SmartCard feature(s)
    during nxssh's ./configure.
